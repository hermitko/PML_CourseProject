This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(dplyr)
pml_train <- read.csv("data/pml-training.csv")
pml_train_select <- pml_train %>%
    select(which(
        apply(pml_train, 2, function(x) sum(is.na(x) | x == "")) < 19000)
        ) %>%
    select(-contains("timestamp"), -contains("window"), -X)
pml_test <- read.csv("data/pml-testing.csv")
table(pml_train_select$user_name, pml_train_select$classe)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
